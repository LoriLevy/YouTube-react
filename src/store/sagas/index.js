/* function* means it is a GENERATOR function, which creates a GENERATOR  object.
Our sagas will take care of all the asynchronous actions that are dispatched. 
To create a store, bundle all sagas into one single saga - the root saga. 
The concept is sort of comparable to combining reducers in Redux.
Calling a generator function doesn't execute its body immediately; 
an iterator object for the function is returned instead. 

Excerpted from developer.Mozilla.org
Generators are functions which can be exited and later re-entered. Their context is saved across re-entrances, so basically,
it is a function that behaves like an iterator. The keyword yield pauses execution, and returns the current value to the caller
or may delegate to another generator function. 

The next() method returns an object with a value property containing the yielded value and a done property which 
indicates whether the generator has yielded its last value, as a boolean. 

Calling the next() method with an argument resumes generator function execution, 
and replaces the yield expression where execution was paused with the argument from next().

Any time a return statement in a generator is executed, the generator finishes and the done property of the object returned by it is set to true. 
Any value returned is set as the value property of the object returned by the generator.
Any error thrown inside the generator will make the generator finished unless caught within the generator's body.
When a generator is finished, subsequent next calls just return the object as: {value: undefined, done: true}.
